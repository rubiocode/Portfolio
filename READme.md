# Welcome to my Web Developer portfolio! Work in progress!


For this early version of my Web Developer portfolio I presented the prospective client/employer with my information, a picture of myself, an about me section, a section for my future projects, and a contact section. In addition, I provided links to navigate through the page as well as links to my GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profile, and my resume pdf. Lastly, I made sure the webpage is responsive at different screen sizes using media queries. Go ahead check my page out!
